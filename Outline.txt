Applied Psychometrics

Why/how is this different:
1. Organized based on project sequence
2. Elements tied to standards 
3. WebR for interactivity right there
4. Graphics for different components**
5. Tests versus inventories and their suceptibility to different forms of response bias

Ideas 
creating technical reports, etc.
Ben to potentially help with any graphics stuff.
