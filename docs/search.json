    "text": "11.1 Title page\nDocumentation of your psychometrics project occurs within a technical report (aka “tech report”). The technical report contains, at minimum:\nYour goal within a technical report is the exacting descriptive communication of the development and investigation of psychometric properties of your focal measure. You should use the reading level necessary to convey your project with the highest level of descriptive integrity. Any anticipated reading–level limitations of technical report information should not restrain your documentation. It is okay to assume a post–baccalaureate reading level – individuals who have similar advanced training to you. Measure–relevant information in the form of white papers, local validation studies, and marketing material are different and should be written for a general consumer audience (7th–grade reading level).\nAlthough you should feel free to use style guidelines (such as may be found in publication manuals such as those offered by APA or MLA), you should not feel constrained by these. The content should reflect the elements within (list-items?), but the format should reflect the authoring organization. Have some fun with the format – use icons, images, and even (non–obtrusive) fonts with restrained abandon. You may want to consult a friend who has experience with graphic design or other artistic ventures. The format should reflect YOU, not some stodgy arbiter of margin dimensions or running head capitalization.",
