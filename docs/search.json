    "text": "11.1 Title page\nDocumentation of your psychometrics project occurs within a technical report (aka “tech report”). The technical report contains, at a minimum:\nYour goal within the technical report is exacting descriptive communication of the development and investigation of psychometric properties of your focal measure. You should apply whatever writing level is best suited to convey your thoughts with the highest level of descriptive integrity. Any anticipated reading–level limitations of how you communicate technical report information should not restrain your documentation. It is okay to assume a post–baccalaureate reading level – aka individuals who have similar advanced training as yours. Additional measure–relevant documentation in the form of white papers, local validation studies, and marketing material should be treated differently and target a general consumer audience (7th–grade reading level), but it is ok for your technical report to be “technical”.\nRegarding the structure of your report, you are free to use style guidelines (such as those offered by APA (American Psychological Association, 2020) or MLA (Modern Language Association of America, 2021)), but you should not in any way feel constrained by these. The content of your technical report should reflect the elements discussed in this chapter (see also Important 11.1), but the format should reflect some uniqueness of the authors. Have some fun with the format – use icons, images, and even (non–wacky) fonts with restrained abandon. You may even want to consult a friend who has experience with graphic design or other artistic ventures. The look and feel should reflect YOU (or the organization you represent), not some stodgy arbiter of margin dimensions or running head structure.\nThe remainder of Chapter 11 focuses on each element of your technical report separately. The entirety of your report is merely an aggregation of these individual elements, although you should give greatest weight (in terms of page space and descriptive detail) to information contained in Section 11.5 and Section 11.6.\nThe title page may also be referred to as a “cover page” – we are considering these terms synonymous for the purposes of a technical report. This represents, with traditional hard–copy reports, the first impression of your project. Branding is important here – if you are representing an organization, there may be a pre–existing preferred format or structure. If you are representing yourself, think about not just this current project, but also future projects that you may wish to conduct. Once you decide on a styling, it is best to stick with it across future projects.\nThe title page elements to include are:",

We construct our tech reports with the title page first, executive summary second, and table of contents third, but the order of presentation of these two elements can be determined by personal preference. Like the title page, you may be creative with the table of contents. If your report is generated in a format that permits, provide hyperlinks to component sections within the table of contents itself.

This review includes an attempt to locate your construct within a broader nomological network (see Chapter 3). If you are creating a measure of a novel or nascent construct, the inclusion of a nomological network becomes more important, and your literature review should include conceptually similar constructs. In addition to conceptual specification of your construct, it is generally a good idea to include a “Why” section within this section of your tech report.1 What is the impetus of creating the measure (e.g., is there a commercial motive, are existing measures lacking, is there a new technology being adopted)?",

Instead, you are communicating all of the important considerations and procedural decisions you made along the process of creating your measure. It is ok to “write too much” here – you want full documentation of steps taken such that an individual 10 years from now would be able to exactly replicate your process.

It does not take much interpretive summary by YOU here to raise red flags to the reader regarding your objectivity. Instead, primarily devote the page space here to limitations, implications, and future directions.\nFuture directions can include plans for futher validation studies — it is ok to propose specific methodologies, constructs, and measures here.

It’s quite likely noone will ever read it, but you did it and the odds are technically non-zero that it’ll be someday relevant, so go ahead and throw it in. Don’t go chasing Figure 11.4, but don’t be afraid if it’s looming.\nYou should have different appendices for qualitatively different content. These are lettered sequentially, starting with “Appendix A”.3 Some individuals prefer “clean” Appendix title pages, such that only the Appendix title is presented and some people include substantive content immediately after the Appendix title (as is done in Figure 11.5). It’s your design choice, but choose one structure and be consistent with it across all appendices.\nIt’s good practice to include your software installations here as well, which can be accomplished easily with .
