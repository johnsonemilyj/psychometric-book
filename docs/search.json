You should use the reading level necessary to convey your project with the highest level of semantic integrity.1\nAlthough you can use style guidelines (such as may be found in the publication manual of the APA), you should not feel constrained by these. The content should reflect the elements within List 11.1, but the format should reflect the authoring organization. Have some fun with the format – use icons, images, and even (non–obtrusive) fonts with restrained abandon. You may want to consult a friend who has experience with graphic design or other artistic ventures. The format should reflect YOU, not some stodgy arbiter of margin dimensions or running head capitalization.",
