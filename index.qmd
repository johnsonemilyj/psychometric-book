## Organizing Principles

1. The structure of the book loosely parallels ***project sequence*** rather than fundamental concepts.

2. Content is linked to corresponding Standards

3. Forks to psychometric orientations where appropriate:

+ Item Response Theory
+ Rasch modeling
+ Classical Test Theory
+ Network psychometrics

4. Applications are interactive
