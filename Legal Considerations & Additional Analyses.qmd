In this section, we will discuss fairness and legal issues surrounding assessments including: APA standards,x,x, case studies, as well as analyses that can be conducted via R.

\*\*Maybe less is more... define, mention protected classes, timeline of landmark cases with ruling and a link to something more in depth, section on AI in testing since it's a hot topic,

2014 APA Standards:

3.  Governing Bodies

4.  Case Studies

**Could create a cool timeline visual to make the chapter feel less dense**

Race Griggs vs. Duke Power Co. Cracker Barrel?

Religion E.E.O.C. v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc. Domski v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan

Sex Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins Bostock vs. Clayton County R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission

Disability

4.  Analyses in R 4/5ths Rule -- Impact Ratio

5. Differential Validity

Put in R code examples and then create a few examples so the student/reader can run and interpret results. I wonder if we have practice examples if we should write another QMD with practice answers???
